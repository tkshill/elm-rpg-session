# How to Contribute

## Overview
This project is written almost entirely in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) aka elmlang, a strongly typed, functional language optimized for web development.

Specifically, we're using a platform called [Lamdera](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/overview) which lets us write both our Frontend _and_ our Backend code in Elm.

## Steps to get working

1. Create a local clone of this repo on your machine.  
2. [Download latest version of Lamdera](https://dashboard.lamdera.app/docs/download).  You'll be using Lamdera instead of the native Elm binary. (At the time of creating project current version is 1.2.0)

For Mac, you would use
```
curl https://static.lamdera.com/bin/lamdera-1.2.0-macos-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/lamdera
chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/lamdera
```
For Windows, download and unpack to the directory of your choice.
```
https://static.lamdera.com/bin/lamdera-1.2.0-windows-x86_64.zip
```

3. If you're using Visual Studio Code, install the Elmlang extension.  
**Note**: There are two language extensions in the VSCode ecosystem but the older (seemingly more popular one) has been deprecated. Pick one marked with arrow on image.

4. Go to your VS CODE settings and find the Elm extension. In the section `Elm LS: Elm Path`, insert the path to your lamdera install directory.

5. Install **elm-format** and **elm-test**.  In your terminal or some other shell environment, type
```
npm install -g elm-format elm-test
```
6. At this point, you should be able to get a local server up and running with the project. Type in terminal: 

```
lamdera live
```
and you are good to go!
