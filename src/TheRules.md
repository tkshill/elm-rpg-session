This game doesn't have a name yet but it is based on [Monster of the Week by Ryan Sands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_of_the_Week), [Absurdia by Quinn Majeski](https://quinnm.itch.io/absurdia) , and [Fate Core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/basics), three absolutely amazing role-playing games that everyone should enjoy.

## Core Concepts

Every game session is called an **Investigation**.

Episodes contain several **scenes**.

The game is run by a **Steward** and contains a handful of **Protagonists**.

This is a [PbtA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powered_by_the_Apocalypse) game and is thus based on a 2d6 dice roll system for rolls.

Whenever a protagnist attempts to do something that has a chance of failure, they must roll a _move_, which means rolling two d6 die and adding any bonuses or modifiers appropriate.

If the total of the roll is:
**6 or less**: The move has _Failed_. Something very bad happens and the player gets one point of **Karma**
**7 to 9**: There is a _Choice_. The protagonist will be asked to choice one of multiple non optimal options.
**10 to 12**: Their move was a _Success_ and their intended act occurs
**13+**: Their move was _Spectacular_ and something **fantastic** occurs.

## Stats

There are four stats that can modify a roll. Every move that requires a roll makes use of one of the stats.

- **Acuity** - Represents Discernment, Creativity, Alertness. Used to find clues, improvise, hide and evade
- **Audacity** - Represents Bravery, Coolheadedness, and Discipline. Used to act under pressure, engage the enemy, be brave
- **Empathy** - Represents empathy, charm, and guile. Used to say the right thing in the moment, sway others, convince people
- **Oddity** - Represents anything abnormal. Used to engage with the weird, magical, or supernatural

Every player starts with a -1, 0, +1, and +2 allocated to the stats of their choosing.

## Portfolios

There are five **Portfolios** players can choose from.

- The **Unnatural** - A monstrous creature fighting other creatures of darkness. (e.g. vampires, werewolves, zombie, banshee, etc)
- The **Magical** - A human who can weild powerful magics (e.g. wizards, witches, shamans, warlocks)
- The **Mortal** - A normal person who has found themselves deep in the world of the supernatural (e.g. the chosen one, an investigator, someone searching for the truth, someone harmed by the unnatural)
- The **Outsider** - A being from beyong this realm with a mission to complete. (eg. angels, demons, aliens, time travellers)
- The **Champion** - A trained hunter of evil (eg. MIB agents, secret martial arts sect, mercenary for international Monster Hunter group, freelance Badass)

## Karma

Karma is the universe's attempt at balance. _Protagonists_ have the ability to use karma to tug at the hands of fate, but every time they do, the universe acts in retribution.

Each Player starts with 1 Karma. You can spend Karma to:

- Reduce hurts and harms
- Updrade a failed dice roll to a Choice or a Success

## Boons and Banes

Certian moves and conditions can give a roll a **Boon** or a **Bane**, providing +1 or -1 to the roll result respectively.
